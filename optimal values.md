_US averages from https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/activity-index_

- **Step count:** 8170 steps
- **Active Duration:** 27 min
- **Avg. time spent sleeping:** 7hr 16min
- **Avg. Resting Heart Rate:** 68 bpm
- **Avg. BMI:** 28.1

- **Flights Climbed:** 2-4 flights per day

**Reference:** [Aerobics, walking and health: A Harvard Health Study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/walking-your-steps-to-health)

- **Distance Travelled:** 30-45 min at 3-4 mph => 1.5 to 3 miles

**Reference:** [2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245588)

- **Basal Metabolic rate (BMR):**

```text
Men: 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) + 5
Women: 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (y) – 161
```

- **Activity Factor (AF):**

| Nature of Activity | Activity Factor |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Sedentary          | 1.2             |
| Slightly Active    | 1.375           |
| Moderately Active  | 1.55            |
| Active             | 1.725           |
| Very Active        | 1.9             |

- Avg. Calorie Intake Required = **Basal Metabolic Rate** (BMR) \* **Activity Factor** (AF)
